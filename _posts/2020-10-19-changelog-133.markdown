## New Features

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5189 -->
* Support configuring workspace features in `Cargo.toml`.
  Now it is possible to enable or disable any specific workspace [feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html) in the `Cargo.toml` file, and `Go to Declaration` and other code insight features will take them into account.
  See more details in the [corresponding](https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5189) issue

## Fixes

* UI improvements:
  <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/6172 -->
  * Use recommended guidelines for settings UI
  
  <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/6179 -->
  * Get rid of scrollbar inside project creation dialog in minor IDEs like CLion
  
* Parser improvements:
  <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/6177 -->
  * Properly parse `tuple.0.0` as tuple indexing supported in [Rust 1.46](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#language-1)

  <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/6202 -->
  * Improve parsing of TOML arrays with syntax errors
  
  <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/6143 -->
  * Properly parse special macro calls with fully qualified names like `std::include`. Now code insight features work as expected for code included using `std::include` or `std::concat`
  
<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/6163 -->
* [Grazie plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12175-grazie) integration improvements:
  * Fix incorrect proofreading annotations on raw and binary string literals
  * Support `String literals`, `Comments` and `Documentation` options in `Preferences | Editor | Proofreading | Grammar` for Rust language

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/6184 -->
* Fix ``Make `self` mutable`` quick-fix of [E0594](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html#E0594) compiler error (by [@ondralukes])

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/6196 -->
* Do not remove required parentheses by `Remove dbg!` intention (by [@t-kameyama])

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/6176 -->
* Show test results in the gutter via red and green icons to differ passed and failed tests

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/6178 -->
* Use public visibility when creating function in other crate by `Create function` intention

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/6258 -->
* Update debugger pretty-printers to fix rendering of `HashMap` and `HashSet` in IDE debugger

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/6048 -->
* Fix running code with coverage on [proc-macro](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html) libs

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/6223 -->

## Internal Improvements
<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/6163 -->
* Provide source code of Grazie plugin while development when `baseIDE` in `gradle.properties` is `idea`. Previously, IDE always showed only class files

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/6221 -->
* Introduce tests for intention scope. Now it is possible to check that an intention is available only inside some text range and unavailable outside.

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/6188 -->
* Improve presentation of regression test results:
  * Use 1-based indices for line/column to be compatible with editor UI and `Go to Line/Column` action
