## New Features

* Better parser recovery inside impls.
* Completion popup is automatically shown after typing `::`.
* Red code: impls with missing or wrong methods are highlighted. A quick fix to
  add missing methods is available.
* Red code: duplicated fields in structs are highlighted.
* Run configurations: when creating a test configuration from context only a
  single target is executed. Useful if you have a lot of test crates in the
  `tests` directory.


## Fixes

* List only modules with Cargo.toml in run configurations.
* Goto class now works for traits.
* Add missing fields quick fix now works if only some portion of fields is
  missing.
* `isCrateRoot` is now consistent with `getCrateRootFor`.
* `isCrateRoot` is much faster, because it no longer does vfs operations.
* Fix a crash when changing standard library location in the older IDE.
* Several formatter fixes (by @jajakobyly)


## Refactorings

* Some resolve tests now use inline Rust code instead of file fixtures.
* CTRS tests and submodule are removed, the source code of rustc and
  standard library is used instead.
* Notifications are completely reworked. No more memory leaks and better UI.
* Structs and enum variants now have a common interface `FieldsOwner`.
