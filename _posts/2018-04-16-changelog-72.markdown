## New Features

* Initial support of macro expansion 🎉
Note: current implementation doesn't take into account `impl` blocks generated by macros,
so all intellisense actions cannot be performed for items from such `impl`s.
Moreover, there may be some performance issues related to macro expansion.
You can switch off this feature via `Rust Settings` (<kbd>Languages & Frameworks > Rust > Expand macros</kbd>)

* Pass variables into an extracted function by reference if possible (by [@t-kameyama])

* Add quick fix to convert types by using `FromStr` trait (by [@oleg-semenov])

* Use `--all-targets` for build/check actions if possible (by [@orium])

* Add ability to pass `-Zoffline` to cargo during building/checking (by [@chabapok])

## Fixes

* A lot of type inference fixes

* Fix wrong top padding in cargo icons (by [@Nilera])

* Don't show false positive `Re-assignment of immutable variable` errors for reference type variables (by [@sgift])

* Take into account extern crate alias while auto import

## Internal Improvements

* More completion-friendly TOML grammar
