## Fixes

* Show `Convert to assert_eq/assert_ne` quick fixes only for `PartialEq` types

* Fix incorrect target path in test run configuration when `#[path]` attribute is used in module hierarchy

* Pass `emit` flag instead of `write-mode` to `rustfmt` from the latest nightly builds (by [@king6cong])

* Save file before run `rustfmt` to format actual file content

* Suggest quick fixes to convert types using `BororwMut` and `AsMut` traits 
only for mutable expressions (by [@oleg-semenov])

* Fix endless loop while matching of `$()*` pattern during macro expansion

* Select correct impl for reference types while method resolution 

* Make item resolution able to work with new macro re-export syntax
