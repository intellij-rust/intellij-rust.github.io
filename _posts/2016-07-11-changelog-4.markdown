## New Features

* We have a [website] :tada: (thanks to [@mkaput]).
* Path to `Cargo.toml` is shown in the project settings.
* Find usages is enabled for all symbols.


## Fixes

* Method calls and field references are properly highlighted.
* `RUSTC` environmental variable is passed to `cargo`, so it now works even
  without `rustc` in `PATH` (by [@madisp])


## Refactorings

* JFlex was upgraded to the patched version from intellij community repository.
  It is now asymptotically faster in some cases (most notably, for markdown doc
  comments).
* A TeamCity configuration is added to track [performance metrics].
