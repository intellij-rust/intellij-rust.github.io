    [E0551](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error_codes/E0551.html), [E0541](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error_codes/E0541.html)

* [#10459] Provide completion for the keyword `let` after `if` and `while` keywords

* [#10424] Provide a quickfix for replacing a constant with a predefined one in std/core library (by [@DeoTimeTheGithubUser])
