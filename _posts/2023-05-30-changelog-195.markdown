The minimal supported IDE platform version for this plugin update is **2023.1**.
To receive this and further plugin updates, please upgrade your IDE to 2023.1 or 2023.2 EAP.

## New Features

* [#10467] Provide support for **2023.2** [EAP](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/nextversion/) builds.
  Note, the Early Access Program gives you free access to pre-release versions of JetBrains software and doesn't require a paid IDE subscription

* Detect new compiler errors:

  * [#10460] `#[repr(align())]` representation hint was incorrectly declared
    [E0589](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error_codes/E0589.html), [E0693](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error_codes/E0693.html)

  * [#10456] A function is using `continue` keyword incorrectly [E0696](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error_codes/E0696.html)

  * [#10450] `break` or `continue` keywords were used in a condition of a `while` loop without a label
    [E0590](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error_codes/E0590.html)

  * [#10426] A literal value was used inside `#[derive]` [E0777](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error_codes/E0777.html)

  * [#10140] A `#[deprecated]` attribute was malformed [E0538](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error_codes/E0538.html),
    [E0551](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error_codes/E0551.html), [E0541](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error_codes/E0541.html)

* [#10459] Provide completion for the keyword `let` after `if` and `while` keywords

* [#10424] Provide a quickfix for replacing a constant with a predefined one in std/core library (by [@DeoTimeTheGithubUser])

## Fixes

* [#10511] Land a temporary workaround for the issue [#10512] "Cannot run tests on Rust 1.70-beta".
  With this fix, the plugin run tests in a simple terminal instead of the rich test-tree tool window
  (if you use Rust 1.70-beta or greater). The test running functionality has been degraded because of
  [rust-lang/rust#109044](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/109044). Please follow the
  [rust-lang/rust#49359](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/49359) tracking issue for the proper fix.

* [#10456] When completing a label in `continue` expression, don't complete irrelevant label names

* [#10421] Fixes false-positive "`#![feature]` may not be used on the stable release channel" (which appeared in rare cases)

## Internal Improvements

* [#10452], [#10453], [#10457] Setup MIR-dataflow framework, experimentally annotate [E0381] and [E0382] using MIR-based
  borrow checker

* [#10455] Drop support for 2022.3 platform
