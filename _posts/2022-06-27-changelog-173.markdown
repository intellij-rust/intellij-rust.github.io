## New Features

* [#8927] Take into account [`#![recursion_limit]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes/limits.html#the-recursion_limit-attribute) attribute for macro expansion. This fixes some unresolved references when using such crates as `async-std` and `tokio`

* [#8919] Implement new approach to detect changes that possibly affect project model

## Performance Improvements

* [#8955] PERF: reduce memory usage by `TraitImplSource` instances

## Fixes

* [#8957] take into account impls for macro types. For example, `impl foo!() { fn bar(&self) {} }`

* [#8952] Complete more methods when autoderef occurs

* [#8950] Consider methods in impls for a reference (`&Foo`) when the receiver is not a reference type

* [#8943] Consider negative impls (e.g. `impl !Sync for T {}`) in type inference

* [#8934] The `clippy::all` lint group will now be completed (by [@Kobzol])

* [#8900] Remove Old Macro Expansion Engine option

## Internal Improvements

* [#8926] Bump jvm from 1.6.21 to 1.7.0
