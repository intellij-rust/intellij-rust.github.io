## New features

* GoTo symbol (<kbd>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+N</kbd>) works for methods.
* Completion works for prelude symbols.
* More formatter options with new code samples in settings (contributed by @jajakobyly).
* It is possible to run all tests inside a single module.
* Functions and statics inside `extern "C" { ... }` blocks are properly resolved.


## Fixes

* Proper lexing of `&&` as one or two tokens
* A ton of fixes for funny bugs in resolve and types:
  - proper scoping for "downwards" resolve: generic parameters are not resolved
    outside the item,
  - `RustPathElement` is not a `NamedElement`,
  - `RustRegPat` is really a RustRefPat (reference pattern) and it is actually
    extends Pattern,
* Couple of NPEs and `IllegalStateExpcetions` during type inference,

* A bunch of tests for type resolving and expression typing.


## Refactorings

* Refreshing RRE: new scopes API, old Resolver class is killed,
enumerateScopesFor is moved inside RRE.

* `RustItemElement` is now an interface.
`RustFnElement` is now a suppertype for a bunch of function-like PSI nodes

* Stubs improvements:
  - methods now have stubs
  - `isPublic` is stored in stubs

* `getIcon` still depends on some AST information, so goto symbol unfortunately
parses the world at the moment.
