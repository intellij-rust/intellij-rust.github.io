This is the last release that supports the 2022.1 IDEs. To receive plugin updates further, please upgrade your IDE to 2022.2.

## New Features

* [#9241] Change the rendering of folded blocks for `use`, `mod`, `extern crate`, and `where` blocks to make them more distinct from folded block comments (by [@afetisov])

  {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-179/fold" w="700px" %}

* [#9176] Use the [`--keep-going` Cargo option](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#keep-going) when building and evaluating build scripts to continue building even if some crate fails to compile

* [#9325] Enable [build script](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html) evaluation in nightly plugin builds for 2022.2 platform

* [#9043] Add [`redundant_semicolons`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/listing/warn-by-default.html#redundant-semicolons) inspection and quick-fix for it

  {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-179/semicolons" w="700px" %}

* [#7435] The intention to convert a match expression to a series of if let statements is now offered in more situations (by [@Kobzol])

  {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-179/match-to-if-let" w="700px" %}

* [#9242] update completions for function attributes including `target_feature`, `proc_macro`, `proc_macro_derive`, and `proc_macro_attribute` (by [@afetisov])

## Performance Improvements

* [#9338], [#9337], [#9334], [#9331], [#9322] Slightly speed up name resolution and type inference

* [#9211] Speed up name resolution of large nested paths like `Foo<Foo<Foo<Foo<...>>>>` by resolving and caching them at once

* [#9213] Use dependencies modification tracker in more places to reduce unnecessary cache invalidations

## Fixes

* [#9352] Allow empty precision in formatting parameter (by [@KarelPeeters])

* [#9351] Fix `Tools | Rust | Share in Playground` action

* [#9327] Fix name resolution of an associated type of a type parameter inside a trait bound, in the case where the type parameter is declared on a level other than the bound

* [#9317] Complete crates from a workspace in `extern crate`

* [#9314] Don't suggest auto-import fix for assoc type binding

* [#9302] Provide proper names for `Undo`/`Redo` actions and records in [Local history](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/local-history.html) for changes made by `Promote Module to Directory` and `Downgrade Module to File` refactorings (by [@afetisov])

* [#9298] Fix ["Inline function"](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8182-rust/docs/rust-refactorings.html#extractmethod-refactoring) dialog when the number of occurrences is unknown

* [#9297] Improve UI of ["Inline function"](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8182-rust/docs/rust-refactorings.html#extractmethod-refactoring) dialog for functions with a large number of parameters

* [#9271] Support the `Unused imports` inspection for public reexports in binary crates

* [#8963] Fix URLs in messages from [external linters](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8182-rust/docs/rust-code-analysis.html#external-linters)

* [#5911] Fix detection of a misplaced `derive` attribute ([E0774](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html#E0774)) compiler error (by [@Stzx])

## Internal Improvements

* [#9296] Remove resolve engine info from the "Create new issue" action because options to use the old resolve engine and the old macro expander are already removed.

* [#9228] Use `ubuntu-latest` runners instead of deprecated  `ubuntu-18.04`
