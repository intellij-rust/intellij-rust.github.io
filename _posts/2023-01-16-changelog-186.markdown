This is the last release that supports the 2022.2 IDEs. To receive plugin updates further, please upgrade your IDE to 2022.3.

## New Features

* [#9747] Support `Create field` quick-fix for struct literals with `Self`

  {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-186/create-field" w="700px" %}

* [#9794] Remove unused imports inside functions by `Optimize import` action
  (only if [Unused import](https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/issues/2158) inspection is enabled)

  {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-186/unused-imports-in-function" w="700px" %}

* [#9441] Fully qualify paths from the local crate that cannot be imported after paste.
  Note, the corresponding feature is disabled by default.
  You can turn it on via `Rust | Insert imports on paste` option in `Preferences | Editor | General | Auto Import` panel (by [@Kobzol])

  {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-186/import-on-paste" w="700px" %}

* [#9883], [#9899] Annotate [exclusive range patterns](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/37854) as experimental

## Fixes

* [#9928] Improve error messages for already defined names:
    - Produce proper [E0403](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error_codes/E0403.html) error for const generic parameters with duplicate names
    - Use the same error messages as the Rust compiler

## Internal Improvements

* [#9926] Provide initial implementation to show code authors hints.
  The feature is disabled by default for now (by [@Kobzol])

* [#9931] Use Kotlin 1.8 for plugin compilation

* [#9879] Refactor name resolution processors
