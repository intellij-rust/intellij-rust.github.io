## New Features

* [#6836] Initial support for [Run Targets](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2021/01/run-targets-run-and-debug-your-app-in-the-desired-environment/).
  Run Targets allow you to build/run the applications youâ€™re developing in Docker containers or on remote machines via SSH

  {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-169/run-target" w="800px" %}

* [#8699] Allow files generated by the `build.rs` buildscripts up to 8 megabytes in size.
  Previously it was necessary to adjust the limit manually using `idea.max.intellisense.filesize` property.
  Note, build script evaluation is disabled by default for now. To turn it on, enable `org.rust.cargo.evaluate.build.scripts` [experimental feature][experimental features]

* [#8713] Update [ML completion] model.
  In addition to the data used before, the new model is now taking into account several new facts to:

  * prefer expressions of type matching the expected type

  * differentiate between inherent, trait and blanket implementations

  * recognise `async`, `const` and `unsafe` contexts

* [#8697] Respect run/debug modes in [Run Anything] by Cargo commands.
  Now you can run a Cargo command under debugger using <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> in Run Anything popup.

* [#7998] Enable [Valgrind on WSL](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/memory-profiling-with-valgrind.html#valgrind-wsl) toolchains

* [#7825] Add an option to use Rustfmt from a non-default toolchain and
  allow to configure addition arguments and environment variables for Rustfmt.
  You can find these settings in `Settings | Languages & Frameworks | Rust | Rustfmt`

* [#7410] Add inspection that finds unnecessarily qualified paths.
  It corresponds to the `unused_qualifications` lint (by [@Kobzol])

## Fixes

* [#8739] Fix parsing of test events with large output in [Test View]

* [#8742] Resolve unit structs in the context of a pattern.

* [#8726] Fix type inference of associated types that are referenced from a cast to a supertrait (by [@Arc-blroth])

* [#8703] Do not highlight [Documentation tests] if there are unbalanced code fences in a previous doc comment

* [#8738] Don't try to release editor of macro expansion view twice.
  This fixes an exception [#8737] that occurs when closing a macro expansion popup.

* [#8706] Rename a URL scheme for macro expansion file system: `rust_macros` -> `rust-macros`.
  The previous name was incorrect because a URL scheme really can't contain an underscore sign `_`.
  This fixes a possible exception during macro expansion.
