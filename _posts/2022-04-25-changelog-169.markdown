## New Features

* [#8713] Update [ML completion﻿](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8182-rust/docs/rust-code-completion.html#ml-completion) model. In addition to the data used before, the new model is now taking into account several new facts to:
- prefer expressions of type matching the expected type
- differentiate between inherent, trait and blanket implementations
- recognise `async`, `const` and `unsafe` contexts

* [#8699] Allow files generated by the `build.rs` buildscripts up to 8 megabytes in size. Previously is was necessary to adjust the limit manually using `idea.max.intellisense.filesize` property

* [#8697] Respect run/debug modes in [Run Anything](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/running-anything.html) by Cargo commands

* [#8675] Use `#[serde(rename)]` attribute for fields that do not use snake_case convention when converting from JSON (by [@Kobzol])

* [#7998] Enable [Valgrind on WSL](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/memory-profiling-with-valgrind.html#valgrind-wsl) toolchains

* [#7825] Allow to configure addition arguments and other options for Rustfmt

* [#7410] Add inspection that finds unnecessarily qualified paths. It corresponds to the `unused_qualifications` lint (by [@Kobzol])

* [#6836] Initial support for [Run Targets](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2021/01/run-targets-run-and-debug-your-app-in-the-desired-environment/). Ran Targets allow you to run the applications you’re developing in Docker containers or on remote machines

## Fixes

* [#8742] RES: resolve RsPathBinding to a unit structs

* [#8739] Fix parsing of test events with large output in [Test View](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8182-rust/custom-pages/docs/rust-testing.html)

* [#8738] Don't try to release editor of macro expansion view twice

* [#8726] Fix type inference of associated types that are referenced from a cast to a supertrait (by [@Arc-blroth])

* [#8706] Rename a URL scheme for macro expansions rust_macros -> rust-macros

* [#8703] LI: Dont inject doctests if there are unbalanced code fences in prev doc
