## New Features

* [#8145] Take into account [const generics defaults] during const evaluation

* [#8070] Suggest private items when completing code inside `New Watch` and `Evaluate` in [Debug](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8182-rust/docs/rust-debug-tool-window.html) tool window

  {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-162/debug" w="600px" %}

* [#8192] Parse and annotate [`~const` syntax]

## Performance Improvements

* [#7947] Fix exception when expanding macros in parallel and enable it by default.
  This is the second attempt to make procedural macro expansion parallel.
  The previous one was reverted because of [the bug](https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/issues/7937).

## Fixes

* Procedural macro expansion fixes:

  * [#8271] Fix expansion of procedural macros that use `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` environment variable
    (for example, macros from [`sqlx`] crate with `offline` feature)

  * [#8233] Fix expansion of proc macros that weirdly mix token spans (e.g. `yew::html!`)

  * [#8203] Fix expansion of proc macros with a float literal in a body

  * [#8278] Fix procedural macro expansion with nightly toolchain

  Note, procedural macro expansion is still under development, and it's disabled by default for now.
  To turn it on, enable `org.rust.cargo.evaluate.build.scripts` and `org.rust.macros.proc` [experimental features]

* [#8261] Fix type inference when the type in `impl` item is also used in associated type projection
  like `impl Trait1<<S as Trait2>::Item> for S {}`, In particular, it should fix type inference and
  code completion with [`sqlx`] macros

* [#8241] Fix handling `$crate` inside detached files

* [#8226] Don't produce [E0277] errors for non fully-known types

* [#8235] Fix false positive [E0277] `trait bound Sized is not satisfied`

* [#8235] Take into account `Sized`/`?Sized` trait bounds during name resolution and code completion

* [#8217] Fix [`Extract function`] refactoring (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd>) for argument of some macro calls like `println!` or `vec!`

* [#8194] Fix `Introduce variable` intention inside match arm

* [#8164] Fix continuous "Preparing resolve data" process when memory is low

* [#8045] Fix auto-import in `include!`-ed files. Previously, `use` items were wrongly inserted into file contained `include!` macro call
