## New Features

* [#10002] Add initial support for 2023.1 EAPs

* [#9991] Drop support for 2022.2 platform

* [#9977] Provide separate icons for constants and statics

* [#9974] FEATURE: Provide `Inject language or reference` intention action inside macro invocation bodies (gif). INTERNAL: Plugin developers now can implement `MultiHostInjector`s to make language injections into some macro invocation bodies

* [#9927] Add support for showing reference usages Code Vision. Note, these hints are available starting with 2022.3 and are currently disabled by default. You can turn it on via `Registry... | org.rust.code.vision.usage` (by [@Kobzol])

* [#9802] changed icons for unsafe items, in Structure View and search (by [@afetisov])

## Performance Improvements

* [#9978] Optimize `Insert imports on paste`

* [#9960] Check if any plugin action is available in the current context in background thread to prevent possible UI freezes in some cases

## Fixes

* [#10032] Part of #10002

* [#10021] INSP: Fix handling Fn trait with path lifetimes in `Needless lifetimes`

* [#10014] Fix a UI freeze caused by navbar

* [#9990] Fix resolve of custom macros with the same name as in prelude

* [#9988] Trim template name and URL when creating a new project using a [custom cargo-generate template](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8182-rust/docs/rust-new-cargo-projects.html#cargo-generate)

* [#9982] mention together with #9971 (by [@foriequal0])

* [#9971] Fixes incorrect macro expansions when block expression is involved (by [@foriequal0])

* [#9945] Suggest in completion methods only from accessible traits

* [#9930] Show a proper error message for usage of undeclared lifetimes

* [#9914] Properly process top-level items by `Main function not found` inspection. Now it takes into account `cfg` attributes and items expanded from macros. Note, you need to enable attribute macro expansion via `org.rust.macros.proc.attr` [experimental feature](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8182-rust/docs/rust-faq.html#experimental-features) to fix false positive `Main function not found` with [rocket](https://rocket.rs/) library

* [#9901] Fix broken compilation of some crates (for example, `thiserror`) after build script evaluation by the plugin

* [#9850] Suggest `Elide lifetimes` fix in case `self` parameter has reference type like `Box<&Self>`

* [#9842] Suggest `Elide lifetimes` fix in cases when a function has `fn` pointer parameters

* [#9786] Fix rendering of huge strings when debugging with LLDB

* [#9589] Fix jumping outside closing bracket/quote with `Tab` when typing

* [#9472] fix default generic arg subst if it refers to another generic param, for example `struct Bar<A = Foo, B = A>`

## Internal Improvements

* [#9974] FEATURE: Provide `Inject language or reference` intention action inside macro invocation bodies (gif). INTERNAL: Plugin developers now can implement `MultiHostInjector`s to make language injections into some macro invocation bodies

* [#9678] Slightly speed up gradle task execution because of better caching
