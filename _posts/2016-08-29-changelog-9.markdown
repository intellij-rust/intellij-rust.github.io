This an entry for several weeks!

## New Features

* Intentions to add/remove braces around single expression lambdas (by [@zjhmale]).
* **Reformat with rustfmt** action. It is not bound to any key combination by
  default, you need to setup binding yourself, or use <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+A</kbd> (by [@zjhmale]).
* Inspections for duplicate items in trait declarations (by [@mbStavola]).
* De Morgan's Laws intention (by [@zjhmale]).
* Inspection for unsafe usage of `CString` (by [@zjhmale]). PSA: code like
  `CString::new("hello").unwrap().as_ptr()` is dangerously broken and memory
  unsafe, see [documentation] for explanation.
* Support for unstable impl trait syntax.
* Show rustup version in the settings (by [@zjhmale]).
* **Goto super** action works for methods (by [@atsky]).


## Fixes

* Symbols from Rust prelude are correctly scoped.
* Fix exponential time parsing of array expressions.
* Don't run several instances of Cargo concurrently. This could have caused
  Cargo to deadlock if there were git dependencies ([also fixed in cargo][cargo-deadlock]).
* Properly display multiline lookup strings in completion (by [@zjhmale]).
* Properly refresh Cargo project when an implicit target like `src/bin/foo.rs` is added.
* Make plugin buildable with OpenJDK (by [@kumbayo]).
* Fix resolve of mod declarations with relative path in the path attribute (by [@kumbayo]).
* Fix NPE when renaming a Rust file (by [@zjhmale]).


## Refactorings

* Stubs for use declaration, foreign modules and extern crate declarations.
* `RustQualifiedPath` abstraction for PSI-independent paths.
* Visitor-driven equality for types.
* New implementation of `ImplIndex`.
* `AliasIndex`.
* Better interface for binary operators (by [@mkaput]).
* Remove bodies from trait and impl PSI.
