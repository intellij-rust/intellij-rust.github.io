## New Features

* [#9412] Support 2022.3 EAPs

* Completion improvements:

  * [#9308], [#9336] Complete [custom derive] procedural macros and automatically add imports for out-of-scope ones

    {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-180/derive_completion" w="700px" %}

  * [#9332] Suggest out-of-scope modules in the completion list. Previously, the completion list contained modules from the current scope only

    {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-180/module_auto_import" w="700px" %}

  * [#9313] Completion for [function-like](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html#function-like-procedural-macros) procedural macros now properly adds `!`
    and doesn't show redundant info about token stream argument

* [#7597] Automatically import unresolved items after pasting Rust code into the editor.
  You can disable this behaviour via `Insert imports on paste` option in `Preferences | Editor | General | Auto Import | Rust` settings (by [@Kobzol])

  {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-180/paste_auto_import" w="700px" %}

* [#5866] Add `Wrong associated type arguments` inspection to check associated type bindings,
  in particular [E0191](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html#E0191) and [E0220](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html#E0220) compiler errors (by [@Kobzol])

* [#9153] Add `Add import for path in pattern` intention to import constants in match patterns

* [#9335] Provide `Create associated function` intention for paths like `Self::func()`

* [#9376] Drop support for 2022.1 platform. Upgrade your IDE to 2022.2 to get new updates of the plugin

## Fixes

* [#9461] Fix sporadic false positive errors and absense of completion related to plugin's inability to find proper `impl` block.
  The bug was introduced by [#9229] in previous release

* [#9434] Don't prioritize functions that return `!` type (e.g. `panic()`) in completion list

* [#9428] Fix expansion of [format](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt) macros like `println!` when the `self` keyword is used as a parameter name, or when the syntax is incorrect

* [#9293], [#9344] Fix [change signature](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8182-rust/docs/rust-refactorings.html#change-sign) refactoring to add imports properly

* [#9303] Do not suggest `Make function async` quick-fix for functions returning `impl Future`

* [#9222] Don't erase the file content during [formatting with `rustfmt`](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8182-rust/docs/rust-code-style-and-formatting.html#reformat)
  if the `#![cfg_attr(rustfmt, rustfmt_skip)]` attribute is presented

* [#9078] Keep the settings for folders that are manually excluded or marked as source roots when reloading the project model

## Internal Improvements

* [#9412] Use Java 17 for development

* [#9361] Split `RsBaseType` into 4 different [PSI](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/psi.html) element types
